# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project presents a machine learning model designed to predict customer churn, helping businesses retain customers by identifying those at risk of leaving. The model uses a structured dataset and explores various features impacting customer loyalty, making it a valuable tool for proactive customer management.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes raw data to prepare it for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes relationships and distributions among features, uncovering insights into factors that correlate with churn.
- **Modeling**: Implements various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict churn, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
- **Evaluation**: Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance and select the best model.
- **Deployment Readiness**: Model can be integrated into a production environment to enable real-time churn prediction.

## Repository Structure

- **`churn_prediction_model.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing data processing, modeling, and analysis steps.
- **`data/`**: Directory for dataset(s) used in the project.
- **`models/`**: Directory for saved model files (if applicable).
- **`README.md`**: Project description and usage instructions.

## Usage
- **Clone the Repository**:
 
  ```
  git clone <repo-url>
  ```
- **Run Notebook**: Open and run `churn_prediction_model.ipynb` to reproduce the analysis and model training.
- **Model Inference**: Use the trained model to predict churn on new data inputs.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Implement real-time deployment for dynamic churn prediction.

## Conclusion

This project provides a robust foundation for customer churn analysis, offering insights and predictions that support strategic customer retention efforts.
